# HonitonRFC-Project
The Project I completed as part of my Adult Learning Software Developer Course at Exeter College.

<p>
  As the final part of our software development course, I worked with a team of people to produce a landing page for Honiton Rugby Club. The purpose of the landing page was to bring greater attention to an event they were holding in the summer of 2023. As the club didn't have much of a digital presence, the landing page would help to drive traffic to the club through a new avenue of media. As the software developer for the team, I had three main areas of work that I covered. I have outlined these below, with the relevant files attached to this repository.

<h2> SRS Documentation </h2>

<p>
  As part of the project, I was required to produce an official Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document. This document was an entire overview of the project outlining how we would go about completing the project, who the target audience was for the webpages, what features would be required and why we have done what we did.
